I'm doing a free, open-source online curriculum designed to teach web development from the ground up, aiming to equip individuals to become full-stack developers called the Odin Project.

I have learned some of the basics of html such as absolute links, relative links, attaching images, and the basics of GitHub.

So far, I know how to create a repo, clone a repo and push it to GitHub.
