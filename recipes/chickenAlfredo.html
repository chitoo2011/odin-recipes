    <h4>Description:</h4>
    </p>

    <p>Chicken Alfredo pasta is a rich and creamy Italian-American dish that combines tender slices of seasoned chicken
        with fettuccine noodles coated in a luscious Alfredo sauce. The sauce, typically made from butter, heavy cream,
        and Parmesan cheese, creates a smooth and velvety coating that clings to every strand of pasta. The chicken adds
        a savory, hearty element that balances the indulgent creaminess of the sauce, making it both comforting and
        satisfying.</p>
    <p>Often served with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or extra Parmesan on top, Chicken Alfredo pasta is a classic
        comfort food perfect for a cozy dinner. It pairs well with garlic bread or a light side salad, allowing the
        creamy, cheesy flavors to shine without being overwhelming. Loved for its simplicity and decadent taste, it’s a
        go-to dish for both casual weeknight meals and special occasions.</p>

            breasts (sliced into strips or bite-sized pieces)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta: Boil salted water in a large pot. Cook fettuccine according to package instructions until al
            dente. Drain and set aside, reserving about ½ cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
            Cook chicken pieces until golden and cooked through, about 5–7 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make Alfredo sauce: In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium and melt butter. Add minced garlic and sauté
            until fragrant (about 1 minute). Slowly add heavy cream, stirring constantly, and bring to a gentle simmer.
            Let it thicken for 3–4 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce is smooth. If sauce gets too
            thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper
            to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine: Add cooked chicken and fettuccine to the sauce. Toss gently until everything is well coated and
            heated through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and extra Parmesan if desired.</li>

    </ol>
